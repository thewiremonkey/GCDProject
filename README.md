#Getting and Cleaning Data


This is the repository for the peer assessment project for the Getting and Cleaning Data class of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization signature track.

##run_analysis.R is a script which:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


##CodeBook.md includes:
- a link to the original dataset
- description of variables used in  he data
- marked down code explaining each step of the run_analysis.R script.

##mean_data.txt:
The tidied dataset (see item 5 above) which includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
